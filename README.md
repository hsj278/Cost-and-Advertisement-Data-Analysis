# Cost-and-Advertisement-Data-Analysis
Data Analysis project on cost of advertising and the effectiveness on different network and how they relate to the sale of the product

###### Description: 
Client XYZ advertises on TV. When customers purchase XYZ’s product, Client XYZ currently
asks their customers how they heard about them and if they say TV, they then ask what network
the customer was watching. With this data, Client XYZ wants to know how much it costs to
acquire a customer through TV, and they want to know what networks are the most cost
efficient. With this information, they want guidance on what networks to stop advertising on
(because they are less cost efficient) and which networks to spend more money.

###### Task:
The purpose of the analysis is to take Client XYZ survey data and find which networks are the most cost
efficient by calculating the following:
1. Cost Per Visitor driven by the TV campaign
2. Conversion Rate (Purchases / Lift), and Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) driven by the
campaign.
Client XYZ wants the above information monthly, and broken down by network.
3. Client XYZ also wants input on how they can improve their survey. Attached to the
assignment is Client XYZ’s survey questions related to TV. Your job here is to tell client
XYZ how they can improve the survey questions.

###### Datasets:
Purchase Exit Survey: This contains purchases for each survey response where a customer
indicated they heard about XYZ through TV. Some customers declined to write in a Network
and just left it blank; or they didn't see the network on the list and chose 'other'. There may be
other discrepancies such as a network having purchases, but no spend, or spend with no
purchases. These types of situations happen with the data and you should not take it as a sign
that you did something wrong.
Airings: This data set shows the spend and "Lift" associated with each individual TV airing.
You'll summarize this data by network to match up with the exit survey data.
Lookup : This table shows the matching names between the survey and the airings so you can
know how to match up the data.
